# File-Permissions-in-Linux

## Project Overview

As a security professional at a large organization, my role involves ensuring that users on the research team have the appropriate file permissions to maintain system security. In this project, I examined and modified file and directory permissions to authorize the correct users and remove any unauthorized access.

## Scenario

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

Note: This scenario involves investigating and updating the same file permissions.
